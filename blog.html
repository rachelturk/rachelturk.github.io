									<h3>My Experience as a women in tech</h3>
									<p>As a women with disabilities in Computer Science, it has become incredibly evident that I study in a primarily male dominated field. Most of my classrooms are filled with men, the majority of my professors are male and during my 3 internships in tech, I have been the only female software developer in the office. This lack of diversity has pushed me to seek out initiatives that work towards a more inclusive and diverse community in tech. Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to be a part of Rewriting the Code, as well as student-run clubs such as MCWiCS (McGill Women in Computer Science) and the McGill Students Chapter of the Scientista Foundation. These initiatives have empowered me to pursue my goals, all while cultivated a sense of community among women in tech. 
									<br><br>
									This blog will aim to highlight some of my positive experiences as a women in tech, but also bring to light some of the negative aspects, and how members of the tech community can do better to improve on them.</p>
									<!-- <h3>Let's work on something</h3>
									<p>There is no better way to break down the gender gap in technology than to create a strong, cohesive network of women in STEM fields and empowering one another. Please feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project, or chat!</p> -->
									<h3>First post coming soon :-)</h3>
